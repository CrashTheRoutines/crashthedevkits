# Library of ready-made templates of pages, blocks and uikits for developing web sites and applications

This Library is collected by me personally from the projects that I do and is distributed freely.

## What is included in this repository?

- **UIKits** - these are various buttons, forms and other interface elements
- **Layout** - this section contains the main blocks of the page (navigation, footer, etc.)
- **Pages** - this is a section with ready-made page templates, in particular templates for index.html and markdown
